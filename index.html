      Why did I choose Philly? well, it’s because I always wanted to travel there. They have 35 square blocks of old
      buildings from the 18th and 19th centuries. There are multiple art and culture museums around the area as well
      that I am itching to see. And of course, the main reason I want to visit is to try their Philly cheesesteaks.
